  <p>Chapter three dictated that we make two html pages, each with a different cascading style sheet.</p>
  <p>Because I dedicate one page to each chapter that left me with a bit of a conundrum.</p>
  <p>Then I decided I would just make a homepage for chapter three and let you travel to the different subpages on your own.</p>
  <p>Thus we come to it. I have made two pages, one for each of my favorite movies. Enjoy!</p>
