    <p>For chapter 4 we were supposed to make two html pages, each with a different tiled background.
    As with the previous chapter, I have made two separate sub-pages for each part of the assignment.
    There were no rules on what you were actually supposed to put on each page, thus I decided to dedicate one page to each of my favorite fictions.
    Thus we come to it. I have made two pages, one for each of my favorite movies. Enjoy!</p>
